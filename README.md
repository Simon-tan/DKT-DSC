### DKT-DSC 


### Data format

First line : the number of skills a student attempted with student ID.
Second line : the skill tag sequence.
Third line : the response sequence.

 ```
    15,1
    1,1,1,1,7,7,9,10,10,10,10,11,11,45,54
    0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
 ```
 
 if you do not have student ID in your data, please use student_data.py to identify student anonymously with random numbers.
 We found some bugs in code. So the result may be a bit different as described in our ICDM paper but it is still better than all other models compared. More efficient models are comming soon.
